# M1-ROUT
Routing is one of the main components of any large scale communication architecture. This course will provide a survey of distributed networked systems, with the goal of understanding the tradeoffs in large, complex systems, primarily by analyzing the design and deployment of real systems. We will cover advanced fundamental principles of computer networks by studying the protocols that hold the Internet together. We will also cover the improvements that have been brought to the Internet in the past few years.  Topics include network security, multicast with IGMP protocol and routing protocols, IPv6 protocol; TCP-IP advanced functions, quality of service architecture, inter-AS routing, and Traffic engineering. The goal is to teach networking fundamentals and techniques as it will provide students with a deep understanding of how the Internet works today, and where it is going in the near future.
